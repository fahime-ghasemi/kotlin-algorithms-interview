# a repository of common algorithms which are useful for an interview
This repository contains 25 algorithms written in Kotlin. <b>Work is in progress</b>, and I want to add more algorithms in the future. </br>

## Who is this repo for?
These algorithms are useful for anyone who wants to be prepared for an interview. </br>
For every algorithms, I've written the time and space complexity and on top of each algorithm I've witten what the question is asking of us. So you can read that description and think about the solution before watching it.</br>
If you are interested in algorithms and data structures, you can watch this repo to be notified of the future updates.</br>
## Contribution
Although this repo is written in kotlin, but if you like to solve the questions in other languages just fork this repo and raise a PR. </br>
